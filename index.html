      <h1>About</h1>

      <p>Magic City Hippies began as a one-man band playing for the co-ed party scene on the streets of Miami — serenading the 20-somethings with a mix of old- school hip-hop covers and breezy pop originals. After months of stealing electricity and stirring
        up crowds of passers-by with his loop-based setup, Robby Hunter was given an ultimatum by the local police: to cease and desist from street performance or to get a gig at a “real bar.”</p>

      <p> Finding sanctuary in the neighborhood dive, Hunter enlisted the support of multi-instrumentalists Pat Howard (drums) and John Coughlin (guitar) for a regular Friday night gig (that paid, of course, in free beer). The trio dubbed themselves Robby
        Hunter Band and released a self-produced, widely acclaimed debut LP in 2013 entitled Magic City Hippies, which included the beachy Hype Machine-topper “Corazón” alongside indie blog hits ”Hard On Me” and “BUST.”</p>

      <p> Encouraged by the international reach and positive reception of their debut, they decided to expand their sound and approach under the better-fitting moniker Magic City Hippies (after the title of their debut LP). In July of 2015, the Magic City
        Hippies released the Hippie Castle EP, with the lead-off track “Fanfare” hitting #1 on bothSpotify’s Global Viral Top 50 and Hype Machine’s popular chart. The EP has accumulated over 10 million Spotify streams to date.</p>

      <p>After the release of two follow-up singles, “HUSH” and “Heart Wants” in 2016, 2017 has already seen a 2-month national tour opening for Hippo Campus and festival spots at SunFest in May and Bonnaroo in June. Magic City Hippies are currently in the
        studio working on their next full-length album, with a slew of national dates planned for Fall and Winter.</p>
